## Description
The Plaxis Material Parser Project is designed to parse material property data from Plaxis FEM software scripts. It extracts information about various material parameters and outputs them in a structured JSON format for easy use and analysis.

## Installation
To run this project, you need Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage
To parse a script, place your Plaxis script file in the `data` directory and run the following command:
The parsed material properties will be saved in the `output` directory as a JSON file.

## Features

The Plaxis Material Parser Project offers a range of features designed to facilitate the efficient extraction and analysis of material properties from Plaxis FEM software scripts:

- **Script Parsing**: Capable of parsing through Plaxis script files to extract relevant information about different materials.
- **Support for Multiple Material Models**: Handles various material models like Mohr-Coulomb, Linear Elastic, and Elastic, ensuring broad applicability.
- **Accurate Data Extraction**: Utilizes regular expressions and parsing logic to accurately identify and extract material parameters.
- **JSON Output**: Converts parsed data into a structured JSON format, making it easy to use in other applications or for further analysis.
- **Update Handling**: Capable of handling updates in material properties when the same property is defined multiple times in the script, ensuring the most recent data is always used.
- **Modular Design**: The project is structured with modularity in mind, allowing easy expansion or modification to include additional material models or parsing functionalities.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple setup and execution process, making it accessible for users with basic knowledge of Python and command-line operations.
- **Well-Documented**: Comprehensive documentation, including a detailed `README.md`, makes it easy for new users to get started and for developers to contribute to the project.
- **Error Handling and Validation**: Robust error handling and validation logic to ensure reliability and accuracy in data parsing.

These features make the Plaxis Material Parser Project an invaluable tool for engineers, researchers, and software developers working with Plaxis FEM software, providing a streamlined approach to handling material properties data.
